# Introduction

In this post, I'll walk you through how I built this portfolio.

## Tech Stack

We used:
- **Next.js** for SSR and performance.
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- **Framer Motion** for animations.

```tsx
export default function Hero() {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
}
```

Stay tuned for more!
